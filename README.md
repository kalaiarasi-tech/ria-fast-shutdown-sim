## 📖 Description

The **ria-fast-shutdown-sim** is a Python-based simulator that helps you understand and validate a fast, orchestrated shutdown process for Reactivity Initiated Accidents (RIA) in high-burnup fuel settings. This tool allows you to verify worth-vs-time targets efficiently, aiming for under 500 microseconds for non-blocking actions. It also handles tail termination and creates outputs in CSV, JSON formats, as well as various plot visualizations. Continuous integration (CI) is included to ensure reliability.

## 🌟 Features

- Validates fast shutdown processes
- Outputs data in CSV and JSON formats
- Generates informative plots using Matplotlib
- Complies with nuclear safety standards
- Designed for non-technical users

## 🖥️ System Requirements

To run this application smoothly, ensure you have the following:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python Version:** 3.7 or later
- **Memory:** 4 GB RAM minimum
- **Disk Space:** At least 100 MB of free space

   - **Linux:** Use your preferred terminal application.
4. Navigate to the extracted folder using the command line. You can type:
   - **For Windows:** `cd path\to\extracted\folder`
   - **For macOS/Linux:** `cd /path/to/extracted/folder`
5. Run the simulator using the command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to simulate the shutdown process.

## ⚙️ Usage

Once the application is running, you will have options to input parameters for the simulation. These parameters could adjust the speed of shutdown or modify safety factors. After you enter the necessary inputs, press the Start button to begin the simulation.

### Input Parameters

- **Shutdown Duration:** Specify how fast you want to simulate the shutdown.
- **Safety Factors:** Adjust these to reflect your safety requirements.
- **Data Output Options:** Choose whether you want the results in CSV, JSON, or as plots.

## 📊 Viewing Results

The simulator will provide real-time updates about the shutdown process. Once completed, you can find the results based on your output settings.

1. **CSV/JSON Files:** These files will save in your designated folder; you can open them in any data analysis tool or text editor.
2. **Plots:** Visualizations will display after the simulation ends, allowing you to see the data graphically.
